<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://desolate-ocean-45261.herokuapp.com/)

A simple Lottery simulation implemented in Rinkeby Test Network that allows you to:

- Buy a ticket for 0.1 ether
- Check how much is in the Reward Pool
- Check how many tickets do you have
- Win big prizes :smile:

There's also a Lottery Pick Winner section that is Owner Visible only, where the owner put a seed (that must be a number) and this is used to calculate the hash of this number and input some randomness in the pick winner function. Of course, this is not production ready, where i should use something like a [Oracle to get random number from outside the chain.](https://docs.chain.link/docs/get-a-random-number/)

I also check for any account's changes in the Metamask to update the UI smoothly. Last, but not least, there's a 10% administration fee for the owner address when the lottery is raffled :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With

- [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/)
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/)
- [Web3](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/)
- [Metamask](https://metamask.io/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

In the following sections you will learn how to clone this repo and get it up and running in no time.

### Prerequisites

You need to have npm installed.

- Download and install node, which already comes with npm:
  - [Download Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo (--recurse-submodules to include the client's submodule folder)
   ```sh
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/vinivst/Lottery.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages in project ("backend")
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Install NPM packages in client
   ```sh
   cd client
   npm install
   ```
4. Register a new account in [Infura](https://infura.io/) and create a new project to get your rinkeby key at
   https://infura.io/dashboard/ethereum

5. Create a .env file at root path

6. Create the MNEMONIC (12 words seed phrase from your wallet) and INFURA_KEY (that you got from step 3) inside .env and save
   ```sh
   MNEMONIC = globe nephew genre emotion morning best penalty trade bid glare unaware dragon
   INFURA_KEY = https://rinkeby.infura.io/v3/you_key_here
   ```
7. Deploy your smart contracts
   ```sh
   truffle migrate --network rinkeby
   ```
8. Change to client directory and run react
   ```sh
   cd client
   npm start
   ```
9. Enjoy your own Lottery! :smile:

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

Users can buy tickets (Metamask didn't shows in the gifs):

![Buy Tickets](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vinivst/LotteryClient/00e42e4d48bcdd8cdae19d0df1e48d2ab2289824/public/buyTicket.gif)

When we have at least 3 participants, the Lottery Owner can pick a winner:
